# Welcome!

>SciTinyML: Scientific Use of Machine Learning on Low-Power Devices will be run regionally for 2022 with seperate workshops for <a href="/SciTinyML-22/africa">Africa</a>, <a href="/SciTinyML-22/asia">Asia</a>, and <a href="/SciTinyML-22/latam">Latin America</a>.

SciTinyML is an ICTP Virtual Meeting supported by the [TinyML4D Academic Network](https://tinyml.seas.harvard.edu/4D/AcademicNetwork) and open to all.

**TinyML is a subfield of Machine Learning focused on developing models that can be executed on small, realtime, low-power, and low-cost embedded devices. This allows for new scientific applications to be developed at an extremely low cost and at large scale.**

The TinyML process starts with collecting data from IoT devices, then training the collected dataset to extract knowledge patterns; these patterns are then packaged into a TinyML model that considers the target microprocessorâ€™s limited resources such as memory and processing power. The resulting model is then deployed on embedded devices where it is used to evaluate new sensor data in real-time. Typically, power requirements are in the mW range and below which enables a variety of use-cases targeting battery operated
devices. TinyML represents a collaborative effort between the embedded power systems and Machine Learning communities, which traditionally have operated independently.

**Workshop Topics:**
+ ML general concepts
+ Introduction to TinyML
+ Getting started with the TinyML training kit
+ Examples of TinyML applications
+ Scientific Applications of ML
